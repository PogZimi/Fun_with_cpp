# FUN WITH C Family

Note:
 
 -> All of my little C++ & C language programs are displayed in this repositry
 -> Some of the files are too old ( when I started to learn to code), I have just reuploaded them. 
 -> So if you might see bad line of code, then forgive me but i am the best. 

  -> It's fun isn't it? 
  -> I am just a kiddo not a professional or a college student . Programming is my passion ( not hobby ) & i do it in my free time . These are really basic programs but intellectually challenging for me. 
  -> Ya and dont even laugh at my code a**hole , if you can write the algorithm then you have my respect or else f*ck offf
