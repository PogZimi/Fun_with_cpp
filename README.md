# FUN WITH *C Family*
# NAMASTE,

*You'll find a collection of my self-taught C++ and C language programs in this repository. Some of these files are from my early learning days, and I've recently reuploaded them. Please pardon any imperfections you might come across; I'm continuously learning and improving.*

*I find programming to be an enjoyable pursuit, a passion I dedicate my free time to. While the programs presented here may be basic, they pose intellectual challenges that contribute to my growth.*

*I'm a self-taught kiddo, not a professional or a college student; rather, I consider myself a learner in this vast field. I welcome constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement. Let's share our knowledge and experiences in the spirit of learning and growth.*

# I am a *proud* & *passionate self taught genius methhead playboy programmer!*
